The Account Manager allows tracking, organizing, and assigning permissions to users on a website or application. It includes administrators and customers:
- Administrators (Admin): Have full control over the system, including creating, editing, deleting accounts, assigning access rights, monitoring activities, and managing data.
- Users/Customers: Can access their personal accounts, update information, track transaction/service history, and use features permitted by the administrator.

Businesses can easily maintain a transparent, secure user system, optimize customer experience, and ensure operational security and efficiency.

1. Account: Username, login email
2. Role: Shows the current permissions of the account

## Access Management

The Access Management tool allows controlling and assigning permissions for each user within the system. With this feature, administrators can determine who can access which areas, use which functions, or edit which data. This ensures the website operates transparently, securely, and professionally. Proper access management not only protects information and prevents unauthorized access but also optimizes the user experience by allowing each person to see and operate only according to their role and responsibilities.
