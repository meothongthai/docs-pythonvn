A menu is a navigation system that helps users easily access important pages or content on the site. Typically, menus are placed in prominent positions such as the top (header), side (sidebar), or bottom (footer). A menu acts like a roadmap, allowing visitors to quickly find the information they need without wasting time searching. A well-structured and clear menu not only enhances user experience but also contributes to the professionalism, aesthetics, and effectiveness of the website.
