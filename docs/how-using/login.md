# Log in to the Admin Panel

How can you access the management area if you have administrative privileges? Please follow the instructions below:

1. In the browserâ€™s address bar, enter **domain.com/auth/login** to access the authentication page. If the browser is already within the domain, you only need to add **/auth/login** right after **.com**, then press Enter to go to the authentication page.

2. On the authentication page, enter your account information and then click the **Login** button. The system will automatically redirect you to the management page if you have access rights to that area.

## How can you get a system administrator account?

- The administrator account is created during the initial system installation if you are the one who set it up.
- You can be provided with an account by a higher-level administrator.
